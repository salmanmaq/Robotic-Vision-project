# Robotic-Vision-project
The repository contains the Matlab code for identifying 2D objects based on color and shape. It was a project for the Robotic Vision MOOC by Peter Corke. It also uses functions from the Machine Vision Toolbox by Peter Corke which is obtainable from his website.

If you use this code somewhere, do leave a note of thanks and let me know. I'll appreciate it. :)

Please note that this code isn't very robust, and the threshold values in getColor.m will need to be adjusted if you plan to use it on different images.

prac.m is the main script and you'll want to have a look at it first.

The project images can be found in the issues tab. The last image "rvf.jpg" is the image used in this project and you will have to download it.
